                <dt>Function:</dt>
                <dd>Arginine is involved in several critical physiological processes, including the synthesis of nitric oxide, which is vital for blood vessel dilation and cardiovascular health. It also plays a role in the urea cycle, which helps remove excess ammonia from the body.</dd>
                <dt>Sources:</dt>
                <dd>Arginine is found in various foods such as meat, poultry, fish, dairy products, and nuts. Plant-based sources include legumes, seeds, and whole grains.</dd>
                <dt>Additional Info:</dt>
                <dd>Arginine is considered a semi-essential amino acid. Although the body can usually produce sufficient amounts, supplementation may be beneficial during periods of stress, illness, or for individuals with specific health conditions.</dd>
