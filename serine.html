                <dt>Function:</dt>
                <dd>Serine plays a crucial role in the synthesis of proteins and phospholipids. It is involved in various metabolic processes, including the production of neurotransmitters and the regulation of cell growth. Serine is also important for the functioning of the immune system and the maintenance of proper cell signaling.</dd>
                <dt>Sources:</dt>
                <dd>Serine is found in foods such as meat, dairy products, eggs, and some plant-based sources like soy products, beans, and nuts.</dd>
                <dt>Additional Info:</dt>
                <dd>Serine is a non-essential amino acid, meaning it can be synthesized by the body. It is involved in the synthesis of other amino acids and has been studied for its potential role in various health conditions, including neurological disorders and metabolic diseases.</dd>
